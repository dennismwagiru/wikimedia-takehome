/*
TODO A: Modify or add styles to make the page look *roughly* like the design
spec file at `design-spec/layout.png`. Don't worry about making it pixel perfect
or matching the colors/spacing exactly. Instead, focus on the alignment of
elements. Elements that appear to be horizontally or vertically centered in the
spec, should be made that way here.
*/

/* Additional TODO IC6 and Above
* TODO B: Responsive Design - Make the page look like the design spec on tablet and mobile.
* TODO C: Optimization - Showcase techniques to demonstrate performance optimization.
* TODO D: Accessibility - Ensure that the page is accessible to users with disabilities.
