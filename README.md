# WikiPHPedia

Dear candidate,

This is a prototype of the new editing interface we're trying out for Wikipedia.[^1]

Features:

* Edit existing articles
* Create new articles

Technical notes:

* Articles are stored in files on disk
* Any user can edit any article

## Your task

There are TODO comments throughout the code.

Your task is to implement code and/or pseudocode to address most of these TODO comments. (Working code is preferable!)

If you don't have time to address all the TODOs, comments or psuedo-code explaining how you would propose to address them are welcome.

What we value in your response:

* Quality commit message(s) (see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Commit_message_guidelines/en)
* Easy to read, well-organized code. Please refactor this mess!
* Documentation
* Attention to security and performance
* Tests for the server-side code

### Note

* There is a lot of flexibility with this exercise! We don't expect you to build a fully-fledged application. We want to see how you approach improving and adding features to existing code.
* We ask that you spend about 90 minutes on this exercise.

## Getting started

TODO: Clearer instructions

1. composer install
2. composer serve - http://localhost:8888/ and http://localhost:8888/api.php
3. composer seed
4. composer test

[^1] This is not a prototype of a new editing interface for Wikipedia. But let's pretend for this exercise.
